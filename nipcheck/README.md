### using NipCheck

Open a nip file in np++. Go to Plugins > NipCheck > Run. Alternative way to start it is to use the diablo 2 icon on your np++ commands bar.
If NipCheck plugin isn't listed, that can happen after you upgrade np++ to a newer version, go to > Settings > Import pluging(s)... and browse to the NipCheck.dll, restart np++ and it's ok.

### known bugs

In case of expressions **plusmaxdamage** and **plusskillferalrage** NipCheck will show:
```
Syntax Errors: Argument invalid in ArithmeticOperator.Eval - Invalid Expression: lhs
```
NIP.xml doesnâ€™t include **plusmaxdamage**, but even if you add it, maybe an additional entry should be added in NipCheck.dll.

Also expression **tier**, used in autobuild **xpac.nip** files isn't included.
