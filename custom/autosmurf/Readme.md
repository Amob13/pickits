# Autosmurf

Those are mostly the pickit files used for [autosmurf](https://github.com/blizzhackers-d2/autosmurf/Readme.md/#Autosmurf).

- these files are already included in the [autosmurf repository](https://github.com/blizzhackers-d2/autosmurf/)

- the subfolder **autosmurf** should be added into ...\kolbot\pickit\ folder
